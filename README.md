# Machine_Learning
This repository contain side projects on machine learning algorithms based on Kaggle Competitions

## Monsters.py
Based on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/overview competition of kaggle, this file contains the algorithms:
  - ΚΝΝ Nearest Neighbor with Euclidean distance
  - Neural Networks with 1 hidden level
  - Neural Networks with 2 hidden level
  - SVM
  - Naïve Bayes classifier
  
After training and testing the data that kaggle provides, accurancy results for each method is provided.
In our case knn algorithm seems to provide the best results.

## Face-Classification.py
Based on https://www.kaggle.com/c/11785-spring2021-hw2p2s1-face-classification competition of kaggle, this file contains the algorithms:
  - Kmeans with Euclidean distance
  - Kmeans with Cosine distance
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
  
After training and testing the data that kaggle provides, accurancy results for each method is provided.
